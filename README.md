This repository contains an implementation of the method described in the paper "Exploring The Ability Of Machine Learning-Based Virtual Screening Models To Identify The Functional Groups Responsible For Binding", by Thomas E. Hadfield, Jack Scantlebury, and Charlotte M. Deane.

Users can generate their own synthetic protein-ligand complexes and use them to train virtual screening models. The deterministic binding rule allows assessment of the extent to which a VS model can correctly identify the functional groups responsible for binding.
